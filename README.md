# The Sydney Coding Club 

The coding club was motivated by
[ozunconf 2018](http://ozunconf18.ropensci.org). The plan is to adopt a similar
format to ozunconf and let the participants drive the agenda. You come to the
designated place and work as much or as little on coding project you want. The
idea is to be surrounded by people who wants to code! People are free to sit
down and work on their own or work with others on a project. The project can be
submitted as an [issue](https://github.com/emitanaka/sydneycodingclub/issues)
on this repository. Occassionally we will have 5 minutes showcase of projects
people have worked on. You can have a look at the list of amazing projects
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf18/blob/master/content/projects.md)
a group of about 50 people accomplished in two working days at the ozunconf18.


# Meeting

The first meeting will occur at **Tuesday 3-5pm 18th Dec 2018, Carslaw 829, The
University of Sydney**.
